This year, the directors were incredibly excited to be making a Star Trek parody video. With one of them being the team’s Trekkie, they immediately got to production. They even wrote two plots because they were quite conflicted on which one to do. One was heavily inspired by the film “Star Trek: First Contact,” and the other one was a bit of a hodge podge, combining elements of The Original Series, The Next Generation and the highly-acclaimed “Wrath Of Khan.” Judging by the title, it’s easy to see which route the story went. Designs for modeling the parody Enterprise were planned to be after Dawson College itself: a copper roof, beige hull, the main entrance window as the deflector, etc.
