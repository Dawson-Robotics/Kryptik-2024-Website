# TUTORIAL

Tutorial had a decent amount of pressure going into it. Dawson’s tutorial strategy last year and this year is pretty clear cut. Since tutorial as a category is often treated as an afterthought or less seriously by the majority of teams, the plan is to up the ante and put as much effort and resources possible into making the most professional tutorial possible and strike while the iron is hot. This paid off in dividends at Avia, as Dawson won first place for tutorial, and the race was on to do it again this year. Since having a strong aesthetic is so important, a lot of time was spent in Blender creating the planets, stars, and graphics in the tutorial and perfecting the overall look.

However, once the look was done, the team was very happy with the final result of the visual aesthetic.

Before even that however, the script for the tutorial had to be written. The tutorial was written and edited by Nathan. Erika did the translation for the script, and Kit’s music for the explanation portion of the video was extended and reused for the tutorial.
