Today marks the return of the USS Dawson after its summer hiatus. This was Robofleet’s annual club fair, where involved Robofleet Academy students showed off their extracurricular projects! Of course, the USS Dawson made its appearance in a valiant and successful attempt to encourage students to join the crew of the USS Dawson.

Today was our introductory meeting to the new recruits of the USS Dawson. After a very successful mission regarding the Avia 2223 Robofleet mission, we are eager to meet the new recruits from Robofleet Academy and prepare for our meeting at Kickoff. This was also my very own birthday, and my wonderful crew surprised me with a slice of pie. It doesn’t get much better than this…

This was a highly important and pressing meeting. Today, we voted on our team’s theme for Kryptik 2224! After extensive campaigning, brainstorming, and deliberating, Star Trek was established to be the inspiration for our kiosk, website, video, and costumes at this year’s competition. Seems to be a promising franchise to anchor the team to, and is somehow oddly familiar.

## Captain’s Log: Stardate 10-06-2223
One of our first official meetings with a proper theme happened today! It was pretty great! The Kiosk Division is already hard at work coming up with Trek-themed ideas, such as monitors, a captain’s chair and even adding Spot The Cat! Those unfamiliar with Star Trek (most members, myself included) are slowly being educated on the wonder of the franchise. The Video Division has already planned on modeling a brand new USS Dawson and has begun pre-production, writing two separate stories and then later deciding on which one to flesh out. The Robot Division has begun assembling its crew members and preparing for Kickoff. Since Kickoff is a month away, we are unsure on what to do for now. The Website Division has been brainstorming to the maximum capacity. All in all, everything seems quite promising.

It’s time for some good old-fashioned indoctrination. The Elder of our crew has helped us pick on some iconic Star Trek episodes to watch for our crew to understand the themes, morals, and memes of the shows. Overall, crew morale seemed pretty high today, despite some complications. Everyone seemed to, at the very least, enjoy the two episodes. I like that Captain Kirk fellow a lot.

## Captain’s Log: Stardate 11-03-2223
Today truly gave Kryptik a whole new meaning to its name. Over the past few weeks, Robofleet has been sending cryptic transmissions outlining the details of the new game (before the Kickoff). This marked the Robot Division’s first great challenge: problem solving. Putting together the slight clues found in their teaser packs proved difficult but rewarding, as it allowed us to predict the mechanisms for this year’s competition. This provided for insight pertaining to robot design and ultimately got the team’s brain working early.

## Captain’s Log: Stardate 11-10-2223
I am devastated. With a new competition on the verge of being announced, we must move on and begin the construction of a new robot. Due to the amount of resources it would take to start completely from scratch, we have made the decision to use the base of our previous robot: Rangu. Rangu was an icon, a beacon of light for all of our crew members. Her majestic arm ascended to the heavens with the press of a button. Her flipper pushed us to the finals and beyond. Without Rangu, the USS Dawson couldn’t have dreamed of winning Avia 2223. And today, she performed her last act: to be stripped away for parts for our new robot. It reassures me that this technically immortalizes Rangu. She lived long and prosperously; it was an honor knowing her.

Today’s the day! Kickoff Day! As per usual, each ship of Robofleet sends an away team, consisting of a maximum of 10 crew members. Also commonplace these days, we were instructed by the heads of Robofleet to head to École Cure-Antoine Labelle to be informed on the Kryptik competition. The robot crew will be delighted to begin progress.

## Captain’s Log: Stardate 11-15-2223
The day has dawned: robot deliberation commences! Despite a minor relocation in facilities (which has been the consistent trend thus far), this has been one of the most productive meetings yet. I recruited our engineering staff to brainstorm for all our potential mechanisms and represent a mockup in the form of a technical sketch on graph paper. The ideas were overwhelming, so much brainpower to work with! I really can always rely on my team.

## Captain’s Log: Stardate 11-17-2223
CODE RED!!! Power outage… Apparently I’ve navigated us into a powerful cosmic electric field, and our facilities’ electricity is depleted. Nevertheless, progress ever proceeds! Brainstorming is a great juggernaut and no obstacles nor challenges will overcome it. Despite this, I admit my courage falters. This is a bit creepy.

## Captain’s Log: Stardate 11-25-2223
Business as usual, progress is ever-growing. Previous electrical equipment has been brought down for the Kiosk Division to analyze, to brainstorm new ideas. The Video Division has begun to work on storyboards, a useful tool to help the two directors envision their shots. The Robot Division used the Klingon technology of portable white boards to throw back different ideas of how to lift and shoot the game pieces to the other side of the playing field, as well as what kind of arm to design.

## Captain’s Log: Stardate 12-01-2223
Another week, another meeting. Our crew members have begun planning some crazy ideas for each aspect of the competition: from kiosk to video to robot. Each division has split to their own tables, in order to be talking to the right people. It gladdens me to see the effort pay off; each division has become its own unstoppable train of progress. My encouragement is appreciated, but my intervention is not necessary. The autonomy of my team truly puts everything in perspective: this year could prove to be our most successful yet!

These USS Dawson Confessions are driving me craaaaaazy!

## Captain’s Log; Stardate 12-30-2223
It saddens me to say this but the entire crew of the USS Dawson is currently under temporary leave. Captain Cass and I have been given a direct order by the Robofleet Environmental Department to go on a biological research mission to the planet of Costaa-R’ica, effective immediately. While I would say that the rest of the crew can easily get key aspects of competition preparation done by themselves, the crew is also unfortunately busy with their delayed Robofleet Academy Final Exams. I do not envy them.

Back in the Greater Montreal Quadrant. Our research mission was a success, but it is time to readjust to life at home. My excitement for Kryptik keeps me going, and my aspirations this year are only becoming more cemented. It is officially crunch time, this is the year of the competition. Our pace is set to increase, but I believe my crew is prepared.

## Captain’s Log: Stardate 01-24-2224
A recent new update has arrived for building our robot. We’ve spent months upon months searching and campaigning for a proper workspace on the ship; we’ve met with admirals, we’ve promoted our crew, we’ve even sent out transmissions. Finally, our efforts have yielded positive results. Our generous Doctor McCoy has no means for one of his nursing facilities, located on Deck Six and so, we have decided to relocate our robot-constructing facility there! This is a colossal stride for the USS Dawson, and we won’t let it go to waste.

## Captain’s Log: Stardate 01-26-2224
Today, we bid farewell to the Holiday Break meetings, as normal routines on the USS Dawson will resume soon. Voice recording for the video has commenced, filming is soon to follow. Prototyping has begun for the robot, and I couldn’t be happier. Crunch time gets ever crunchier.

## Captain’s Log: Stardate 02-05-2444
Much has happened in the past week. Filming has made amazing progress, we’ve adjusted and adapted to our new workspace (not to mention decorated it). Captain Cass and I have been making extensive orders for materials; our new workbench has just arrived! I’m relieved to be able to fall back on my team of engineers when I am busy with my entrepreneurial ventures as captain. I hope to be able to blow off some steam soon with my comrades and friends, we could certainly use it.

## Captain’s Log: Stardate 02-09-2224
Today marks the official unveiling of our finalized robot-constructing facility! It is much more spacious than the previous one, allowing us to have more chaos. Some of our members have begun dismantling priceless ancient electronics to be used for our new kiosk. We have also “discovered” a humorous faceplate for our robot. The engineers had a very productive day today, testing out a basic prototype for a spiral lifting mechanism, among other prototypes. Thankfully, my hard work has been gratified by a recreational outing with my crew on the planet Three Amigos. They make amazing Earth nachos there.

Today, multiple kidnappings were reported to my co-captain and I. Upon further inspection, it is just the work of the two Video Division directors, in need of extras for a scene. They managed to get a room on Deck 3 and filming just wrapped. They managed to get a lot of the crew as extras! Even Vice Admiral Jason Kirsch joined us for a cameo! All this work has made me exhausted!

## Captain’s Log: Stardate 02-23-2224
This is the weekend where we grind on the video. While we filmed some of the scenes earlier, today is the day where we film the scenes involving the bridge: which comprises a bit more than half of all the scenes. The process has been lengthy but fun. Our directors were able to guide our cast members, including co-director Commander Darcy, into acting properly and the set used is a blast! I am very interested in filming more tomorrow and seeing the final cut. Captain Cass plays a phenomenal villain, it is almost too convincing…
