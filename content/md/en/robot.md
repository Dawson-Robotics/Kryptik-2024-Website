Every year, each Robofleet starship is required to manufacture a representative robot which participates in the physical competition and doubles as the team’s beloved mascot. This year, Kryptik has proven to push our limits further than we’ve ever hoped.


This robot has four main mechanisms: the intake, the conveyor, the dropper, and the launcher. These four work in synchrony as the game pieces make their journey through the robot.


First, the intake is an elaborate spinning shaft dressed with funneling mecanum wheels to orient the game pieces to the conveyor. 

This provides an efficient method to collect balls with little need for precision. 


The first ball storage mechanism that was prototyped was based on an archimedes screw. It was made using an extrusion frame as well as several individual cardboard sections with tension relief cutouts. It was unfortunately ineffective.


The second ball storage mechanism that was prototyped used several small vex motors and skateboard wheels since the smaller motors would not be countered with the total number of high power motors. Another option is to translate the force using polyurethane belts.


The third prototype was a wire spiral with a fixed beam to provide vertical motion from the intake to the shooter. As the wire spiral spins, it lifts the ball that is caught on the beam.


The current dropper prototype designs which shall be used in the point multiplication system all rely on a crucial component which is a cardboard cement pouring tube. It has a diameter of 8 inches which is perfect for storing the game pieces with gravitational potential energy at the start of the match.


The current prototype in development for the firing mechanism is a single wheel flywheel. It uses a bent metal sheet to increase the contact time and energy transferred to the ball.
