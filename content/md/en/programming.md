# Programming
The USS Dawson’s communications department has been hard at work receiving and decrypting Robofleet’s subspace messages. Using specialized programming techniques, we have successfully developed algorithms to solve decryption problems in mere picoseconds. Furthermore, using similar techniques, the engineering department was able to resolve Robofleet’s challenging field simulations, which allowed us to optimize the structure of our dilithium chambers. This new cutting-edge research netted the USS Dawson a whopping 12% increase in dilithium lifespan, hopefully allowing us to explore even further regions of space. Now, however, we have intercepted another Robofleet subspace signal. It appears to contain a schematic of some sort, but access is hidden behind a firewall. In order to decrypt the message, it seems that our programmers will have to solve a game, one oddly similar to Earth’s tic-tac-toe…
