# KIOSK

The kiosk is our main home during the competition. It’s the place where we spend most of our time in between games during the comp, we hangout there and it’s important for it to represent who we are. We want to make the theme come out and be recognizable in our kiosk, such that all the people passing by can recognize our theme as they walk by.

This year, our kiosk represents the main USS Enterprise bridge. We tried to recreate the iconic bridge and added some personal touches to personalize it. We painted the top of the walls in a gray that matches the the bridge in the original series of Star Trek. We added some windows opening up to the space. The windows have a view of outer space and various interstellar objects such as star dust. There were also shelves with control panels and we managed to do a lot of wiring to make some buttons we found functional. The buttons can connect to LEDs and turn on the blinking red lights for “code red”. Code red is also coupled with our dear Captain Jacob Kirk’s majestic voice on a speaker system announcing the emergency. Not to leave the red alert as the only alert, there is also a yellow alert. Other color codes include random blinking lights of various colours simulating an evolving control panel on the bridge, moving white lights to simulate the USS Dawson preparing to move and a gradient of light that will go from yellow to red for a fake self destruct mode. There are also knobs in the kiosk that will be able to continuously change the brightness of the lights and the volume of our speakers.  Massive hats off to Tinh, William, Nafiseh, and Vlad for all their work with the arduino and the wiring.

Additionally, we reused last year’s chair and gave it a makeover and some upgrades to turn it into the captain’s chair: big hats off to Adam, Léa, and Hannah for making this work. The cube was also redesigned and repainted on the sides by Sara and Julia. There will also be a simple 2D scratch game in the kiosk that will put the USS Dawson in a maze where the player must navigate out of. Another scratch game will be a first person game where the player must click different buttons on a command system to escape a hostile planet. Big props to Yianni for developing these games. A floppy disk system that will play different Star Trek related videos will also be at the ready. We also have lots of posters made by our members on the walls that were used for the video and also for the kiosk.
