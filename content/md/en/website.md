# Website

The design of the home page was a long arduous process, many hours were spent adjusting minor details in a css file. There was a lot of pressure on us given the amazing homepages made in the past. However, after countless hours spent trying to center a div, eventually the home page started coming together into the beauty you can now see on all our screens. Thankfully, the members working on the page are computer science students with experience in web development and under the careful guidance of team leads Izzy and Sila the homepage creation process went pretty smoothly.

We tried to think of ways to fit the Star Trek theme, getting ideas and inspiration from things we researched. We eventually found a site that inspired us to make the Star Trek control Panel which brings out the Star Trek vibes in general. We added our own touch as we implemented a 3D model of the USS Enterprise on the Home Page, the color scheme giving this a nice blue theme. We also made it accommodate various screen sizes too, being able to show our work within various devices, thanks to Adam for implementing this for the Home page. With this we Put the StarFleet Command logo as a button for you to press so you can venture around our site, reading our journals, captain logs and all others with the useful buttons on the left hand side with the help of our member Fred for making the nav bar.
