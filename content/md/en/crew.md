Kickoff day has finally come!! All the crew members who went to kickoff managed to carpool with either Justin or Nafiseh to get to Laval (the commute would’ve taken soooo long, but that’s an issue for April!) Kickoff was so much fun and it was great to see one of our old captains (hi Jason!!) and some other old members as CRC volunteers (hey Trevor!). We also had a ton of fun with the game piece and even played a little bit of volleyball!

Today, kiosk members went looking for old electronics and reusable materials at Dawson’s shipping and delivery department. We managed to find a lot of screens and keyboards that we used for video and for the kiosk. Also, we had a visit from our friends at Vanier robotics (hey JJ and Brie!!). We gave them a tour of Dawson and we went to 3 Amigos after, for supper, it was a ton of fun and it felt great to hangout with them. Besides, robotics suppers at 3 amigos are a tradition that we cherish a lot now! -Rosie

It was another late night at Dawson robotics, and as we were all cleaning up a song from pokemon featured in a popular meme of a cgi lizard dancing came up on the playlist that was rolling. Inspired by this, some of the members got together to recreate the dance which led to some pretty good laughs. Our captain Cass filmed it for the team.

Video filming is about to start but disaster strikes! The 3D printed badges remain unpainted at Léa's house and she's in class and unable to retrieve them! Short of other options, Nathan, who was done class for the day and is Léa's brother spent the next two hours running home and back to Dawson to retrieve the badges. Once the badges arrived at Dawson, Léa, Tinh and Liem painted them at the last second and the video was able to be filmed as planned! Crisis Averted!

With the deadline uncomfortably in sight, crew members Nathan and Erika begin discussing the plan for what to make the tutorial about. After ideas are exchanged back and forth and the two are short on hope, the idea of making a tutorial on tips when picking a CRC theme enters the fray, and once Nathan brings up the new plan to Captain Jacob, the tutorial gets approved, and once the three discuss ideas further, tutorial production begins

All the department heads met on this day for a little meeting. We realized we’re slightly behind on some things and made a game plan to be strategic with our time management here. Also, the infamous Nathan incident took place during this very meeting :3

After celebrating the birthdays of our crew mates Rozhina, Erika, and Jason, we found some abandoned camcorders in the room we were using to celebrate. With them we tried out some of our photography skills with a lens flare and on members Jacob and Simona.

after weeks of trying to understand the control board and leds, we finally managed to successfully connect them together thanks to Nafiseh and her incredible equipement. We are still having trouble with the buttons and switches, but I'm sure that with Nick and William's help too, we can figure it out.

The buttons and switches are indeed working! Nick tested them yesterday and today, with William and Nafiseh, we managed to connect them and code them as to give life to our red alert system. We would still like to hopefully use the potentiometer.

William was trying his best to make the potentiometer work. At first, we realized that it had way too much resistance, but truly, William's first mistake was to connect things badly. I may have screamed at him and discouraged him a bit, but as the amazing person that he is, he found a way to work with the potentiometer!

With the walls mounted, we realized that the painting work one them wasn't truly finished. With Rozhina and our captains gone, I tried taking charge of finishing up the walls. At first, Justin and Ericka helped me with some priming work and some cover ups, but I later on realized that the paint we had gotten wasn't fitting the original wall colour. I panicked a bit and has some trouble contacting Rozhina, but in the end, with Liem's very helpful hand, we managed to colour all the walls properly and they look amazing!
