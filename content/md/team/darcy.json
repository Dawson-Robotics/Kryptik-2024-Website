I have made so many strong memories, pursued new skills and interests and most importantly, made many great friends along the way. From Vertigoal to Kryptik, this place has been my source of creativity for so long and I am excited for what the future awaits. \"It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.\" -Jean-Luc Picard, Star Trek: The Next Generation",
